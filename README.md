## What the application do?
The project that I propose to do this term is a stock gain or loss calculator. 
After entering a number of stocks each stock containing:
- the number of shares **(double)**
- the Purchase Price **(double)**
- the Sale Price **(double)**  
- the Dividend earned **(double)**
- the Buy Commission **(double)**
- the Sale Commission **(double)**
- the CGT(Capitals gain Tax) **(double)**
The user will get a summary on if they will gain or lose if they sold the stock with the price they are selling.
The summary will include
- Was it a profit, a lost, or did it break even for each corresponding stock entered **(List of String)**
- the earning of all the stocks entered in total **(double)**
- the names of all the stocks entered **(List of String)**
- how much to sale it for to break even for each corresponding stock entered **(List of String)**

## Who will use it?
People who are investing in stocks in hopes of making profit may find my application useful. Knowing results such as 
profit or loss made with their sale price may make them hold their stock longer or want to sale the stock now.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
This project interests me because my dad has being stocks ever since I was born, but I have not really learnt much 
about it yet. Given the opportunity to have my own idea for a project I decided to kill two birds with one stone by 
using this opportunity to learn more about stock sas well as enhance my programming ability.

## User Story
- As a user, I want to create a stock and add it to a list of stocks.
- As a user, I want to know if selling a list of stocks I entered at certain prices will be a profit or loss.
- As a user, I want to know the names of all the stock I entered.
- As a user, I want to know how much I will gain or lose when selling each stock in the list of stock I entered.
- As a user, I want to know how much I should sell each stock in the list to break even.

## Phase 4: Task 3
- Make classes to specifically deal with each of buttons JLabel, JTextbox, etc in ui. As I found that in my design
the code was very repetitive.
- Create more helper methods especially in ui classes to deal with repetitive code
- make a class specified in improving the design (add color, change font etc) of the ui features 
(eg. JLabel JTextbox etc) to improve the look of the GUI
- Make pop up error windows when user enters an invalid value when adding a stock to stock list instead of displaying 
it on the console
